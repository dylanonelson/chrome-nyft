# The Kingdom and the Fucking Power
This extension changes all references to “The New York Times” to “The New York Fucking Times”. It will not work on the masthead at nytimes.com, since the masthead is an image and not text. I have filed a bug with the Times's customer support fo fix this.

This is not an official product of the New York Fucking Times.
